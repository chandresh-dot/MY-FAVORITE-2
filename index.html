        i love to draw comics.I have draw more than 50 comics but they are 1 page 25 scences and drawed 10 book comics but maximum I use 3 papers = 10 pages.the thing in drawing comis is that I have make my own story which takes a lot of time,then you have to draw it yourself.You know what you want to draw but you don't get it the way you what.Which makes it tough to make a COMIC.But when you complet to make a comic. your hadrwork pays.I wish to become a comic writter.
